		<h3>I found a photo of a rare spotless giaraffe</h3>
		<main>This baby giraffe was born on July 31st and is so rare that it is believed 
		to be the only solid-colored reticulated giraffe living anywhere on the planet.</main>
		<p>The cause of the solid-colored coat are suspected to be either a genetic mutation or 
		a recessive genotype in one or more genes related to the pattern.</P>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197789671/a-rare-spotless-giraffe-gets-a-name-to-match">
		Standing 14 to 15 feet tall, the creatures are the tallest land mammals in the world. 
		When mothers give birth, the calves are already 6 feet tall, and apart from especially rare occasions, 
		they're born covered from hoof to horn in brown spots.
